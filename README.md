# Progress-wunder-list
  This idea pump into my mind when I was using wunderlist. Although there are tons of scheduling softwares, I want to do some customization to add some new feature.
  - Trace the progress of everydate plan
  - Show the chart of daily plan completio
  - Show the curve of the week, plan
  - Show bitmap of month or year plan
  - Reminder 
  - Could apply attachment for a single task, using command line to operate, like git
  - Synchronize with clander
